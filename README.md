## ESE MSc latop setup guide
This repository contains instructions for setting up your laptops for use on ESE masters programs. This configuration contains all required software for the Modern Programming Methods/Numerical Programming in Python modules and is the base configuration for any future modules. Setup instructions for Windows, MacOS and Ubuntu (Linux) can be accessed by clicking on the appropriate logo below.

Note that GEMS students will, at a later date, need to install ICFERST. Instructions for setting up ICFEST are included in this repository for completeness, but its use will not be required until the 2nd term. It is recommended that you've thoroughly tested and are comfortable with the base setup before attempting to install ICFERST.
